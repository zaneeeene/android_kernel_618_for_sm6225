#!/bin/bash
# k618_tp.sh [jobs] [name ...]: Qualcomm's techpack driver repos (display, GPU, camera, audio, video,
# WLAN, crypto, IPA ...) built as external modules against our GKI 6.12 and the soc tree, for kalama.
#
# Each repo is laid out for `make -C <kernel> M=<dir> modules <ROOT>=<dir>`, which is how Qualcomm's
# own Android.mk path builds them; its Kbuild then picks the chipset's configuration from
# CONFIG_ARCH_KALAMA. They are built in dependency order and each one's Module.symvers is added to
# KBUILD_EXTRA_SYMBOLS for the ones after it, so modpost resolves across repos.
#
# Sources in $K618/vendor/qcom/opensource (k618_tp_get.sh puts them there), results collected in
# $K618/tpmods, log per repo in $K618/tp-log. With names given, only those are built (their
# predecessors' symbols must already be there). Run it in a memory-capped scope.

	# video515 BUILDS (msm_video.ko). Where the 5.15 code met an interface that had moved, the answer
	# was taken from Qualcomm's own 6.12 release rather than invented: the system-cache DMA attribute
	# becomes 0 (their 6.12 video driver writes `|= 0UL /*TODO: define ...*/`, and soc's
	# qcom-dma-mapping.h defines DMA_ATTR_SYS_CACHE as (0UL) when the kernel has none), the best-fit
	# IOVA allocator call goes away (in their 6.12 camera driver that function is empty for >= 5.15),
	# and vb2_queue's count is read with vb2_get_num_buffers(). All of it is in k618_tp_fix.py.
	#
	# eva515 BUILDS too (msm-eva.ko), and from the 5.15 release rather than the 6.12 one on purpose:
	# the 6.12 EVA still has a kalama branch in its Kbuild and still carries kalama's generation of
	# the HFI definitions as cvp_hfi_v1.h, but its C files have moved to the v2 names, so the packet
	# ids for this phone's firmware would be ours to guess -- while the 5.15 release's definitions
	# are what the phone's own evass firmware answers to. Rewriting the interfaces it meets is the
	# safe half of that trade: synx v2, iommu_map's gfp, of_icc_get, const bus_type, the file
	# refcount, iosys_map, qcom_scm_assign_mem, ghd_rm_get_vmid -- all in k618_tp_fix.py.
	# Its bus votes have nowhere to go on this phone: the cvp@ab00000 node still has the 5.15 form
	# (qcom,bus-master / qcom,bus-slave per child) and 6.12 reads interconnects/interconnect-names,
	# so of_icc_get() gives the NULL path the interconnect core documents as "skip setting
	# constraints" -- EVA runs without bus scaling until the node gains those two properties.

# The vendor configuration, as the techpacks have to see it. The kernel's autoconf.h has only the
# GKI options; the ~380 the soc tree adds (QCOM_RPROC_COMMON, the minidump and IPC logging ones,
# mem_buf, ...) live in the soc build's own gen/autoconf_vendor.h, which nothing here included --
# so every IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_<vendor option>) in a shared header gave the techpacks its stub.
# synx-driver, for one, was built with the qcom_register_ssr_notifier() that returns NULL, and its
# init then frees itself and still returns 0. Qualcomm's own DDK build compiles them against the
# combined configuration, so they get it here too -- less the chipset selectors (CONFIG_ARCH_*),
# which the techpacks take from the make variables below (kalama), not from the soc's canoe base,
# and less the options below, which name drivers this phone does not have:
#   LEDS_QCOM_FLASH   canoe's new flash-LED driver, which binds "qcom,spmi-flash-led". This phone's
#                     node is "qcom,pm8350c-flash-led", driven on its own 5.15 kernel by the older
#                     leds-qti-flash (CONFIG_LEDS_QTI_FLASH, which we do build), so the camera has
#                     to take its QTI path: with this option defined it calls instead
#                     qcom_flash_led_get_max_avail_current, which only canoe's driver exports.
